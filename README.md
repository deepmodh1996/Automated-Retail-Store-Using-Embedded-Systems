# Automated-Retail-Store-Using-Embedded-Systems

This repository contains work done in preoject of "Embedded System" course during Spring 2018.

Project is inspired by [Amazon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Go), **Computer Vision** based partially-automated store where customers
are able to purchase products without using a cashier or checkout station.

Our aim is to reduce computational cost inherent in using Computer Vision on such a large scale. Project aims to provide **Embedded Systems** and **IoT** based solution to replace the ‘checkout station’ for convenience of
customer by saving time. We plan to use location tracking along with weighing mechanism to identify purchased products.
